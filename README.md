## Description
This is a software programme that manipulates numbers in that:

1) When a user enters a number, an output of all the numbers up to where the user entered their number is produced with the following conditions;

* All the numbers divisible by 3 are replaced by ping.
    Input               Output
    3		            1,2,ping.

* All the numbers divisible by 3 are replaced by ping.
    Input               Output
    5		            1,2,3,4,pong.

* All the numbers divisible by 3 are replaced by ping.
    Input               Output
    15		            1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,pingpong.

An example of everything combined will look like this:
